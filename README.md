# Flappy Bird - Unity Game

Welcome to **Flappy Bird**, a simple yet challenging game developed using Unity. Inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, the objective of the game is to navigate the bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them.

## 🎮 Gameplay

The player controls the bird by tapping (or pressing the space bar) to make it flap its wings and stay in the air. The bird must pass between sets of pipes to score points. The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

## 🛠 Features

- **Flap Mechanic**: Tap or press the space bar to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles.
- **Procedural Pipe Generation**: Pipes are randomly spawned at varying heights to create dynamic obstacles.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points by passing through the gaps between the pipes.
- **Game Over Screen**: A game over screen appears when the player loses, with an option to restart the game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes (optimized for 1080p).
